# 30239 Notes Repository

## How to use this Repo

I will push notes to this repository throughout the quarter, so if you are keeping your own notes in this repository you should generally keep them in separate files to avoid accidental git conflicts.

Either make companion files in each directory, or keep your notes in a separate directory/notebook altogether.

### Marimo Notebooks

Marimo notebooks are similar to Jupyter notebooks, but work much better with Git and have some other nice features I appreciate.

If you have ever looked at a Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) in an editor, you know they are large JSON files, and once they are checked into Git changes become very difficult to track.


`uv run marimo`
