These are showing essentially the same thing, one shows individual models and the other uses some aggregates with confidence intervals.
These are from the same page of the IPCC report.

## What causes uncertainty?

1) **measurement error** - An instrument used has some non-perfect degree of accuracy. In a survey, this could be a poorly-worded question.
2) **model uncertainty** - Models make assumptions and simplifications, different assumptions lead to different outcomes.
3) **sampling variability** - Differences between sample & population.
4) **missing data** - How missing data is accounted for & represented.

The result is that we have a range or distribution, where we want a number to use with one of our channels (Hue, X, Y, etc.).

## Challenges of Uncertainty

Often left out, in part due to being hard to understand, and even harder to visualize.

Omission however misleads audiences, especially where a lot of significant figures are included.

*Global Population Uncertainty: Â±160 million people (2%)*

## Challenges of Uncertainty

Uncertainty estimates are simplified, often out of necessity.

![](weather.png)

30% chance of rain: "A 30% chance that at least 0.01" of rain will fall somewhere within a given area over a 12 hour period."

## Challenges of Uncertainty

Complexity of visualization can overwhelm audience, obscure other meaning.

From a data-ink ratio perspective, it is understandable why if the error bars do  not seem relevant to a narrative, that they would be omitted.

---

## Including Uncertainty

If omitting uncertainty misleads, it violates our prime directive of **graphical integrity**.

The job then, is to find ways that are **audience appropriate** & **don't obfuscate the meaning**.

The difficulty will be in resolving this tension.

---

## Common Techniques

- Uncertainty as Probability
- Error Bars
- Confidence Bands

---

## Uncertainty As Probability

Random waffle chart: works for cases with discrete outcomes.

---

## Uncertainty As Probability

In practice, we often care about more than boolean outcome.

We can convert this to discrete measurements: quantile dot plot.

## Uncertainty of Point Estimates

These work when we're focused on uncertainty around a particular outcome.

Sometimes we need to show uncertainty around discrete measurements, or projections.

### Error Bars

---

### Error Bands

![bg left](altair-errorband.png)

```python
line = alt.Chart(source).mark_line().encode(
    x='Year',
    y='mean(Miles_per_Gallon)'
)

band = alt.Chart(source).mark_errorband(extent='ci').encode(
    x='Year',
    y=alt.Y('Miles_per_Gallon').title('Miles/Gallon'),
)

band + line
```

---

### Issues with Error Bars & Confidence Bands

1) There is no pre-defined meaning of these intervals.
  **If error bars or bands are included, the legend must include information on the meaning.**
2) Error bars are common in scientific & academic literature, other audiences cannot be assumed to understand them.
3) Restricted to 1D/2D dots. If variable being expressed is mapped to color, area, etc. then alternative presentations needed.

### Variations on Error Bars & Intervals

![](ci-2.png)

<!-- when appropriate, can also be used to show multiple intervals -->

<!--care should be taken that distribution is indeed normal if curves/etc. chosen  -->
